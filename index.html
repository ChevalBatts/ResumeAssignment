        <h2>Graphic designer & photographer</h2>

        <p>Hello there ,<br> I am an aspiring graphic designer and photographer. I was born and raised in North Carolina, I'm originally from a small middle of nowhere town called Middlesex which only had one stop light. Since then I've moved and aspired to reach my full potential as a graphic designer. I am currently 24 yrs old and I am disabled, a paraplegic to be precise every since 20120 due to a car accident. However, I have not let that stopped me from reaching my goals as here I am now living alone and attending college and that work ethic right there of not letting anything hold me back is what I bring to the table along with my pristine work and attitude </p>

          <div><img src="Images/Soda Ad.gif" alt="Soda gif of 3 different flavors"></div>
          <p>For this project I was instructed to create a can drink, it could of been juice,water,soda, coffee and ect. the list can go. I personally went with an energy drink as a college student I became quite well appointed with energy drinks. In the beginning stage I was thinking of a milk carton with tiger imagery called Tiger Milk some type of protein amped milk but the concept didn't really resonate with me. Then keeping with the animal theme I went along with a zebra theme and decided on an energy drink, with a simple name like strip because just with stripes </p>
